<blockquote><p>The only story that seems worth writing is a cry, a shot, a scream. A story should break the reader’s heart. Susan Sontag</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Who wants to become a writer? And why? Because <a href="https://www.theodysseyonline.com/5-reasons-why-writing-is-important" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it’s the answer to everything</a>&#8230; It’s the streaming reason for living. To note, to pin down, to build up, to create, to be astonished at nothing, to cherish the oddities, to let nothing go down the drain, to make something, to make a great flower out of life, even if it’s a cactus. Enid Bagnold</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Writers are not here to conform. We are here to challenge. We&#8217;re not here to be comfortable — we&#8217;re here, really, to shake things up. That&#8217;s our job. Jeanette Winterson</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>A writer without interest or sympathy for the foibles of his fellow man is not conceivable as a writer. Joseph Conrad</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Everybody else is working to change, persuade, tempt and control them. The best readers come to fiction to be free of all that noise. Philip Roth</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>It is the writer who might catch the imagination of young people, and plant a seed that will flower and come to fruition. Isaac Asimov</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Find out the reason that commands you to write; see whether it has spread its roots into the very depth of your heart; confess to yourself you would have to die if you were forbidden to write. Rainer Maria Rilke</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>One writes most of all in order to take part in a collective enterprise. Italo Calvino</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Deliver me from writers who say the way they live doesn&#8217;t matter. I&#8217;m not sure a bad person can write a good book. If art doesn&#8217;t make us better, then what on earth is it for. Alice Walker</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Writing, the art of communicating thoughts to the mind through the eye, is the great invention of the world&#8230; enabling us to converse with the dead, the absent, and the unborn, at all distances of time and space. Abraham Lincoln</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Yes there is a meaning; at least for me, there is one thing that matters &#8211; to set a chime of words tinkling in the minds of a few fastidious people. Logan Persall Smith</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>When I sit down to write a book, I do not say to myself, ‘I am going to produce a work of art.’ I write it because there is some lie that I want to expose, some fact to which I want to draw attention, and my initial concern is to get a hearing. George Orwell</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The only end of writing is to enable readers better to enjoy life or better to endue it. Samuel Johnson</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Don&#8217;t write so that you can be understood, write so that you can&#8217;t be misunderstood. William Howard Taft</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The role of a writer is not to say what we all can say, but what we are unable to say. Anaïs Nin <a class="clicktotweet" title="Click to tweet!" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The role of a writer is not to say what we all can say, but what we are unable to say.

<blockquote><p>Show up, show up, show up, and after a while the muse shows up, too. Isabel Allende</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>How to be a better writer: -write about what fascinates you -make one point per sentence -use stories to make your point -cut extra words like “really” and “very” -read the whole thing out loud -post publicly (you’ll try harder when you know others will read it). James Clear</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The only environment the artist needs is whatever peace, whatever solitude, and whatever pleasure he can get at not too high a cost. William Faulkner</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>At the end of the day your ability to connect with your readers comes down to how you make them feel. Benjamin J. Carey</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>At its best, the sensation of writing is that of any unmerited grace. It is handed to you, but only if you look for it. You search, you break your heart, your back, your brain, and then — and only then — it is handed to you. Annie Dillard</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>To write well about the elegant world you have to know it and experience it to the depths of your being just as Proust, Radiguet and Fitzgerald did: what matters is not whether you love it or hate it, but only to be quite clear about your position regarding it. Italo Calvino</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>When you’re trying to create a career as a writer, a little delusional thinking goes a long way. Michael Lewis</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>There is a great deal that either has to be given up or be taken away from you if you are going to succeed in writing a body of work. Susan Sontag</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>A writer, like an athlete, must ‘train’ every day. What did I do today to keep in ‘form’?

					<p>Yes, that&#8217;s true.<br />
We need to remember, like Ernest Hemingway said, that the first draft of everything is shit.<br />
It helps us &#8220;just write&#8221;.<br />
That&#8217;s where the magic happens.</p>
<p>Good luck with your writings.</p>

					<p>I love Ernest Hemingway. He speaks very boldly and frankly. Ego tests with thoughts of Charlotte Bronte: if you do not go through with the topic about which you write, the creation will not work, but if you penetrate it completely, you can skip everything around.<br />
But Pablo Picasso &#8220;Without a lot of loneliness, no serious work is possible,&#8221; I have a double opinion. Alone, the author has the opportunity to focus on thoughts, but also alone he cannot get inspiration.<br />
Thanks to great people for clever thoughts.</p>

					<p>I loved the clarity with which Hemingway wrote.<br />
And for the Picasso quote, I agree that it would have have been good to have more nuance in this quote, or perhaps more context.<br />
I believe solitude can bring some of our greatest thinking but we are still tribal animals that connection to be really &#8220;complete&#8221;.</p>
